## QSAR Modelling of Protease from HIV-1 for Drug Discovery Research    
1. Processed bioactivity data of Protease derived from HIV-1
2. Performed Exploratory Data Analysis by calculating Lipinski descriptors
3. Developed Regression Model using Random Forest Regressor to generate a scatter plot of experimental v/s predicted
pIC50 values and compared the model with other ML Algorithms
